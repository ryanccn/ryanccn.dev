  <h1>Hello, I'm Ryan!</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">I'm a high school student and a hobbyist web/app developer. I'm also learning a bunch of other things like Minecraft modding!</p>

  <p>I do some web development in my spare time. I have a website here, and I also made <a href="https://moddermore.net/?ref=ryanccn.dev">Moddermore</a>, a web app for making mod lists that's becoming pretty popular! I'm well versed with technologies such as <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, etc.</p>
  <p>In the open source world, I contribute to <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a>, maintain the community bot, and am a Community Manager in the Discord community. I also contribute to and help translate <a href="https://modrinth.com/">Modrinth</a>. I wrote the <a href="https://fig.io/">Fig</a> `ffmpeg` autocompletion spec. You can check out a variety of other projects on my GitHub and <a href="/projects/">the projects page</a>.</p>
