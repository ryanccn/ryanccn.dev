  <h1 class="title">Hello, I&rsquo;m Ryan!</h1>
  <p class="subtitle mb-10">High school student, open source developer, and privacy enthusiast.</p>

  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I do some web development in my spare time. I made <a class="accent-link" href="https://moddermore.net/?ref=ryanccn.dev">Moddermore</a>,
    a web app for making Minecraft mod lists that&rsquo;s pretty popular; I also have an assortment of other web platform projects.
    Lately, I've been doing more programming with <a class="accent-link" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, a language that
    I've come to really enjoy using!
  </p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
    In the open source world, I contribute to a lot of projects and organizations. Among my highest profile contributions are to
    <a class="accent-link" href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a> and <a class="accent-link" href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a>,
    but you can see all of my activities on <a class="accent-link" href="https://github.com/ryanccn">my GitHub</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed">
    I write blog posts about what I do! Feel free to <a class="accent-link" href="/posts/">peruse the archive</a>;
    there are {{ collections.posts.length }} of them at the moment.
