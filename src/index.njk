# Hello, I'm Ryan!

I'm a high school student and a hobbyist web/app developer. I'm also learning how to make mods with [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org) and Fabric!

I do some web development in my spare time. I have a website here, and I also made [Moddermore](https://moddermore.vercel.app/?ref=github-readme), a web app for making mod lists that's becoming pretty popular! I'm well versed with technologies such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/), etc.

In the open source world, I contribute to [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/), maintain the community bot, and am a Community Manager in the Discord community. I also contribute to and help translate [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/). I wrote the [Fig](https://fig.io/) `ffmpeg` autocompletion spec.
