As 2021 draws to a close, I suppose it’s time for me to start babbling about what I’ve learned about in web development this year. Every year contains new surprises and new releases of libraries and packages and all sorts of other stuff, so there’s quite a bit to talk about.

(Not a very decent introduction)

## Brave Browser

First of all, I became “braver” and started using [**Brave Browser**](https://brave.com)! Safari’s privacy safeguards were not that optimal, the extensions weren’t all that available, and many Web APIs behaved in weird ways. Which is not so nice for a web developer. So I switched to Brave, which happens to be based on **Chromium,** arguably the browser engine that’s most up-to-date and on the cutting edge.

I still use **[Ghostery](https://ghostery.org/)**, though — it’s a nice complement for blocking trackers that Brave misses.

One annoying little caveat I discovered about Brave, however, is that it blocks all `navigator.sendBeacon` requests by default. Which makes sense from a privacy hardliner’s perspective because `sendBeacon` is used for logs and analytics, never for serious data exchange (that’s what it was built for, at least). However, from the perspective of a developer who’s trying to collect useful, privacy-respecting analytics, Brave is penalizing the use of modern Web APIs like `sendBeacon` and forcing them to use other methods such as `XMLHttpRequest` ([Plausible](https://plausible.io)) and make-believe images ([Fathom](https://usefathom.com)). This is most certainly not an optimal situation. I hope that Brave can be more lenient towards privacy-respecting analytics and logging services.

## 1Password! 🎉🎉🎉

Before, I had passwords in a mess of CSV files, Chrome, Brave, and iCloud Keychain. I had to copy and paste passwords from other places when I needed them, and when I had to use passwords in apps I had to go into _browser settings_ to copy the password.

Well, I guess I finally understood why unified password managers have a big market.

So I tried out **[1Password](https://1password.com)**, which seemed to be the leader in the industry. Which it was. The UI looked amazing (especially on the beta 1Password 8), the encryption was detailed in [a really nice white paper](https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf), and the experience on macOS was really smooth.

I’m still in the 90-day trial right now, but there is no doubt that I will pay for 1Password once the trial ends. It’s just so good.

(I am not sponsored 🙃)

## Electron

I went into **[Electron](https://electronjs.org)**, because I wanted to build a better-looking and minimalistic Minecraft launcher after I’d seen many launchers which were heavyweight, made with Java, and took ages to start up. I hesitated for a long time because the multi-process model in Electron felt daunting.

Which it was. Fortunately, [the Vite Electron Builder starter](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder) made the learning process much simpler for me, because I didn’t have to configure all of the npm scripts and other things to get started. It also came with **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)**, which is a wonderful build tool.

The Inter-Process Communications (IPC) model was a source of confusion and consternation for me as I ran huge node scripts inside the renderer process and tried to access the DOM from the main process... But after a bit of learning from example and error traces, I got it straight. I’d like to detail the IPC model in a blog post “coming soon”, but for now this diagram would suffice:

{% respimg 'images/ipc-2021.png', 'Diagram on the Electron IPC model' %}

I’m working on the Minecraft launcher right now with Electron and Vue, to be released sometime in 2022. ✨

## TypeScript

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** makes coding with JavaScript just so much easier! For those of you who don’t know what TypeScript is, it’s basically an extension of JavaScript that contains types and connects with your IDE via language servers to provide you with better autocomplete and linting.

TypeScript is a _really_ great productivity booster. It’s incredibly useful when you don’t know how to start working with a library, because, well, you can just look at the type of its exports and the types of arguments the functions receive and get started without ever needing to even look at the docs!

TypeScript can also help you find errors in your code. For instance, this instance of JavaScript fails really quietly until you run it:

```jsx
const thisIsAThing = 1;

console.log(thisIsAThng);
//                 ^^^^
//                 spelling mistake
```

And other more sophisticated mistakes. In contrast, TypeScript shows up with a big error message straight away and also provides useful hints:

```tsx
const thisIsAThing = 1;

console.log(thisIsAThng);

/*
(error from TypeScript)
Cannot find name 'thisIsAThng'. Did you mean 'thisIsAThing'? ts(8888)
example.ts(1, 7): 'thisIsAThing' is declared here.
*/
```

It also helps you when you’re expecting some types and want to enforce them: for instance, if you want to have a function return a string, you can enforce it by writing

```tsx
const prefix = (original: string): string => {
  return "[ryanccn.dev] " + original;
};
```

That way, if you lose track of what your code is doing and write something else that’s not supposed to be there, such as

```tsx
const prefix = (original: string): string => {
  console.log("[ryanccn.dev] " + original);
};
```

The TypeScript compiler will very promptly throw an error:

```
A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value. ts(8888)
```

So you see, that’s incredibly useful.

I’m using TypeScript in all of the projects in which I _can_, because it’s such a productivity booster and makes for a wonderful IDE experience.

(Unfortunately, Eleventy does not support TypeScript, which is why I’m considering moving this site to Next.js — yet again. 😅)

## clank

This is a project born out of my own convenience and a generally open source spirit. **[clank](https://github.com/ryanccn/clank)** is a simple CLI made with **[Deno](https://deno.land)** (more on that later) that compiles your C++ source file into a custom cache directory before running the executable.

The CLI experience is made with [Cliffy](https://cliffy.io/), a very useful CLI toolkit for Deno.

Some features include:

- **Passthrough** `std{in,out,err}`
- Prints **status code** and corresponding signal
- A **cache** based on unique hashes of files
- **Smart deletion** of cached files to keep cache size under 0.5 GB
- Configure **which compiler** to use
- Passing options **directly to compilers**
- An incredibly convenient **upgrade command**
- **Shell autocompletion** support
- Looks great

The gist of the `clank` workflow when you run a C++ source file is this:

1. It creates a hash of the source file using SHA-256 in the Deno standard library.
2. It checks whether this same file has been built before by checking whether the executable file exists in clank’s cache.
   1. If it doesn’t exist, it compiles the source file using `clang++` or `g++` (depending on your OS) to a file named with the hash.
   2. If it does, it skips compilation and goes straight to execution.
3. It executes the executable with `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` all set to `'inherit'` so that the experience is just like if you were running it directly.
4. It exits, but not before it checks if the cache size is above 1GB. If it’s above 1GB, it uses a cool algorithm based on the age of the file and the size of the file to determine which files to delete first.

This project was fun to make and easy to use — if you also do CS competitions in C++, using clank will absolutely speed up your workflow!

This is how to install if you have Deno already installed:

```bash
deno install -Af -n "clank" --import-map "https://deno.land/x/clank/import_map.json" https://deno.land/x/clank/mod.ts
```

Then, just run any C++ file like this:

```bash
clank hello.cpp
```

## Deno & Deno Deploy

**[Deno](https://deno.land)** is the cool new runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript made by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js. It’s cool, because it tries to comply completely with the Web APIs commonly used in browsers, and it’s incredibly modern, with top-level `await` (which is still not generally available in Node.js) and modern ES syntax built right into it.

It’s fast, because it’s made with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) (among many other CLIs), and it includes a formatter, linter, compiler, documentation generator, and other tools in one bundle of a CLI.

It uses **ES Modules**, which is ever so useful, and it imports only via URLs, which relieves you of the burden of having to maintain a `package.json` and makes it incredibly easy to test out libraries.

Correspondingly, **[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)** is

> a distributed system that runs JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly at the edge, worldwide.

It runs Deno scripts that you can just run with the Deno CLI on your local dev environment, with support for the built in HTTP server modules. It’s a distributed worker architecture, like Cloudflare Workers and Lambda@Edge, so it loads really fast, and it’s really easy to make because everything is based on Web APIs, like `fetch` and `Request` and `Response`.

For instance, this is from the source code of my link shortener at `a.ryanccn.dev`:

```tsx
const handler = async (req: Request) => {
  const fragments = new URL(req.url).pathname.split("/").filter((a) => !!a);

  if (fragments.length === 0) {
    // root url
    return responses.redirect("https://ryanccn.dev");
  }

  if (fragments.length >= 2) {
    // more than 1 piece of path
    return responses.notFound();
  }

  if (req.method !== "GET") {
    return responses.notAllowed();
  }

  const res1 = await get(fragments[0]);

  if (!res1.ok || !res1.data) {
    // no redirect exists for such an id
    return responses.notFound();
  }

  // ok
  const res2 = await click(fragments[0], res1.data.clicks);
  return responses.redirect(res1.data.t, res1.latency + res2.latency);
};
```

It looks really simple, and with the flexible ES Modules system built right into Deno, it’s easy to modularize functionality, as you can obviously see from the imports from `./db.ts` (in which I connect to [Supabase](https://supabase.io)) and `./responses.ts` (in which I have functions for creating `Response`s).

Deno is a promising piece of tooling for the future, and the only problem now is that the ecosystem is not yet complete, so many sophisticated setups required for building big web apps and native apps are not possible. However, building simple scripts with Deno has been a wonderful experience, and I look forward to the day when I can use Deno to build a desktop app or a mobile app or something in IoT. The future is endless! 🚀

## Lines of code (tokei)

These are clips of output in each of my projects from [**tokei**](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei), a CLI (as always, written in Rust) that counts your code really quickly. It deserves a checking out!
